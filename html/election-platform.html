                                Hello friends and colleagues! My name is Eddie, and I am running to be your CMSA President. You may know me as the person who shares announcements and study resources with you all, or perhaps as the “Discord guy.” I want to begin by saying that you all have extraordinary backgrounds and stories; it would be a privilege to serve you in a formal capacity.
                                <br><br>
                                A little about me: I have served in student government and on national committees dedicated to education and student advocacy throughout the past few years. During this time, I collaborated with University of Alberta faculty and students to redesign my program, Engineering Physics, with new courses and policies to better serve student and industry needs. My goal, if elected, is to continue serving and ensuring the best possible medical school experience for each of you.
                            </p>

                    <h3 class="small-spacer">My Vision for the CMSA</h3>
                    <!-- intro -->
                    <p>I envision three overarching themes for our class and the CMSA:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>Creating a community where every student's voice is heard,</li>
                        <li>Fostering a culture of collaboration and support amongst our class, and</li>
                        <li>Facilitating a medical school experience with ample opportunities and resources to succeed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <p>Here is how I aim to achieve that vision.</p>
                    <br>

                                        <li>Create an academic support and resource platform where our peers can share and access study materials (e.g., the Google Drive, Discord),</li>
                                        <li>Share accessible mental health resources and fix the currently broken mistreatment reporting link on Osler,</li>
                                        <li>Allocate a greater portion of the CMSA budget towards student wellness items (e.g., a platform to easily access support systems, more functional microwaves in the student lounge, better pool tables),</li>
                                        <li>Develop a tool to keep track of relevant student conversations (e.g., study groups, post-exam party groups), and</li>

                                        <li>Collaborate with faculty and CMSA partners to increase funding to support students facing hardships (e.g., financial difficulties, late acceptance off the waitlist, student-led initiatives),</li>
