Please keep in mind that the difficulty and review I provide is subjective to my personal experiences immediately after finishing each course; your mileage may vary. I do not intend to rate the professors out of respect for them.

                                    <p>This class presented a straightforward approach to the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The majority of the problems in this course involved setting up energy and mass balance equations then plugging in values from thermodynamic tables. There are short assignments due each week, which are a great source of practice (and free marks). The class GPA for this course was a 2.7/4.0 for the winter 2022 semester.</p>

The second half of the course focused on the efficiency and entropy of these devices and thermodynamic cycles. This course covered the Otto, Diesel, Brayton, refrigeration, and Rankine cycles.</p>

All of the network theorems and analysis techniques (minus magnetic coupling and complex power) apply in this course, so make sure you know them by heart. In my opinion, the best way to do well in this course is to grind practice problems and sample exams. Top tips: know Norton, Thevenin, mesh, and loop analysis; make a nice summary sheet on bode plots and op-amps; do a bunch of practice questions; and you'll be golden.</p>

                                    <p>The first part of this course focuses on analyzing first- and second-order circuits (i.e., using differential equations). Don't worry if you're rusty at solving ODEs—this course presents many shortcuts to solving them. The second part of this course analyzes circuits in the frequency domain. Here, we rely on phasors and eventually the Laplace transform. Bode plots are also introduced to analyze the frequency response of circuits. The third part of this course studies operational amplifiers and diodes, which play a key role in larger integrated circuits.</p>

At the start of the course, you cover fundamental concepts like linearity, superposition, BIBO stability, memory, convolution, and elemntary signal properties. You then build on these concepts in linear time invariant (LTI) systems and analyze these systems using Fourier and Laplace. You learn the relationship between the Fourier and Laplace transforms. You also touch on cool topics such as AM radio and filter design (filters are also covered in ECE 203). Overall, this was a very straightforward course where you prove various properties then use them to solve computational problems. If can do the assignments and practice exams, you will do well in the course.</td>

                                    <p>If you liked Newtonian mechanics, you'll love this course! This was one of the most difficult classes I've taken, courtesy of Kirk, but also one of the most satisfying and beautiful courses I've had the pleasure of studying. The most difficult part about this course is setting up the equations and being extremely diligent with algrebra/calculus. Each assignment took multiple hours to complete, so beware. Nonetheless, you will prove interesting problems in the assignments, such as: (i) Is there a contradiction in Netwon's third law for two charges approaching each other from orthogonal angles?. (ii) What is the angular frequency of a spring on a rotating system? (iii) Why do planets orbit the sun such that the line between the planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times? (iv) How do we generate symmetry? To do well in this course, understand the fundamental theorems well, be careful with your computations, and practice, practice, practice!</p>

                                    <p>The first half of this course reviews many concepts from first year physics but takes them one step further; you'll learn Newtonian mechanics in polar and cylindrical coordiantes, intrinsic coordinates, velocity-dependent forces (e.g., drag), linear and angular momentum, and energy in the context of vector calculus. Then, you will analyze oscillating systems: damped oscillations, coupled oscillators, and small oscillations. The second half of this course is where things get spicy. You first prove the Euler-Lagrange equations and other topics in calculus of variations (e.g., geodesic problems, Brachistochrone problem) then use the Euler-Lagrange equation in the context of Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics is a powerful extension of Newton's second law in scalar form, and you will be able to solve increasingly complex problems such as the double pendulum problem in an algorithmic manner. Lagrangian mechanics turns into one of the most beautiful theorems about symmetry and conserved quantities: Noether's theorem. Towards the end of the course, you will learn about two-body central force problems, an extension of Lagrangian mechanics which plays a critical role in orbital mechanics and quantum mechanics. Finally, you will cover the basics of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

                                    <p>Ever watched Intestellar or thought about what Einstein did? Well now you can learn all about it! This course was a whirlwind introduction to special relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The special relativity unit is arguably the wackiest, where you learn about time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic mechanics. You will also learn that E = mc<sup>2</sup> is simply a special case of the more general energy-momentum relationship, E<sup>2</sup> = m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> (this relationship will be derived by integrating the derivative of relativistic momentum with respect to position). After special relativity, you'll learn how light and charge became quantized and then delve into wave-particle duality alongside the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You will then derive the Schrodinger equation and see how it leads to many crazy phenomena like quantum tunnelling and the EPR paradox. You will finish the course by deriving the quantum numbers which form the basis for modern chemistry and see the necessity for relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>

                                    <p>Honestly, the best way to do well in this course is to take advantage of the extremely easy quizzes as the midterm and final will likely drag down your mark. For the special relativity unit, understand the meaning behind every equation, as plug and chug will not work here. For quantum mechanics, learn how to solve the Schrodinger equation and how to interpret and use the equations you derive from it. For most students, special relativity is a lot more difficult to understand than the quantum mechanics unit.</p>

At the end of this course, you will choose an experiment out of a list of prescribed experiments, write up a lab report, and present your findings in front of the class. Also similar to 292A, many of the statistical concepts taught in the lecture sessions are quite advanced for someone without having taken an introductory statistics course, but the application of the tests are quite straightforward. This course was overall pretty chill and a good opportunity to hang out with the engineering physics cohort (this class is only for engphys students).</td>
