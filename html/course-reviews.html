                    <p>This page contains a list of all the courses I've taken at the University of Alberta. You may find the description for each of these courses in the <a class="url" target="_blank" href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue">University of Alberta course catalogue</a>. For each course, I include a description of the course and tips for doing well. For select courses, I give a shoutout to professors who went above and beyond in teaching. Please keep in mind that the difficulty and review I provide is subjective to my personal experiences immediately after finishing each course; your mileage may vary.</p>

                                    <p>ECE 202 is an extension of the circuits concepts you learned in high school. Other than to derive maximum average power and capacitor and inductor phasor relationships, there is minimal calculus in this course, i.e., ECE 202 is all about algebra and problem solving. Xihua was one of the best profs I had: good pace, efficient, tons of examples, good homework practice, and excellent summary sheets. The class average was 2.9/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>You will start off by reviewing Kirchhoff's laws (KVL and KCL) then quickly build upon them with more powerful analysis techniques with DC circuits. The major techniques include loop analysis, mesh analysis, superposition, source transformation, Thevenin theorem, and Norton theorem. The later parts of the course introduces AC circuit analysis in the frequency domain; all of the DC techniques apply to the AC case. The course finishes with an introduction to complex power, magnetic coupling, and transformers.</p>

You typically have one week to complete the lab report, but for the big formal lab report, you'll have two-to-three weeks to write up to 10 pages of "research." Be warned, you will likely need to do self-studying to learn how to use the statistical tests presented. You will also learn how to use Python to analyze data (though if you're lazy or are a masochist, you're allowed to use Excel for analysis later on). The coolest experiment in this course (in my humble opinion) is the superconductor lab, where you get to make a superconductor and hover a magnet over it when the superconductor is cooled with liquid nitrogen.

Each assignment took multiple hours to complete, so beware. Nonetheless, you will prove interesting problems in the assignments, such as: (i) Is there a contradiction in Netwon's third law for two charges approaching each other from orthogonal angles?. (ii) What is the angular frequency of a spring on a rotating system? (iii) Why do planets orbit the sun such that the line between the planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times?

Then, you will analyze oscillating systems: damped oscillations, coupled oscillators, and small oscillations. The second half of this course is where things get spicy. You first prove the Euler-Lagrange equations and other topics in calculus of variations (e.g., geodesic problems, Brachistochrone problem) then use the Euler-Lagrange equation in the context of Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics is a powerful extension of Newton's second law in scalar form, and you will be able to solve increasingly complex problems such as the double pendulum problem in an algorithmic manner. Lagrangian mechanics leads to one of the most beautiful theorems about symmetry and conserved quantities: Noether's theorem. Towards the end of the course, you will learn about two-body central force problems, an extension of Lagrangian mechanics, which plays a critical role in orbital mechanics and quantum mechanics. Finally, you will cover the basics of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

This course was a whirlwind introduction to special relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. JP is a pretty chill and funny prof, so you're in good hands in this course (though I'm not a fan of the PowerPoint slides you learn from). The special relativity unit is arguably the wackiest, where you learn about time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic mechanics. You will also learn that E = mc<sup>2</sup> is simply a special case of the more general energy-momentum relationship, E<sup>2</sup> = m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> (this relationship will be derived by integrating the derivative of relativistic momentum with respect to position). After special relativity, you'll learn how light and charge became quantized and then delve into wave-particle duality alongside the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You will then derive the Schrodinger equation and see how it leads to many crazy phenomena like quantum tunnelling and the EPR paradox. You will finish the course by deriving the quantum numbers (which form the basis for modern chemistry) and see the necessity for relativistic quantum mechanics.

For the special relativity unit, understand the meaning behind every equation, as plug and chug will not work here. For quantum mechanics, learn how to solve the Schrodinger equation and how to interpret and use the equations you derive from it. For most students, special relativity is a lot more difficult to understand than the quantum mechanics unit.</p>

At the end of this course, you will choose an experiment out of a list of prescribed experiments, write up a lab report, and present your findings in front of the class. Also similar to 292A, many of the statistical concepts taught in the lecture sessions are quite advanced for someone without having taken an introductory statistics course, but the application of the tests are quite straightforward. This course was overall pretty chill and a good opportunity to hang out with the engineering physics cohort (this class is only for engphys students). The class GPA for this course was 3.1/4.0.</td>
