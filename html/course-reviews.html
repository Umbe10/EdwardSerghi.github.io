                    <p>This page contains a list of all the courses I've taken at the University of Alberta. You may find the description for each of these courses in the <a class="url" target="_blank" href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue">University of Alberta course catalogue</a>. For each course, I include a description of the course, tips for doing well, and the class GPA (for my class section). For select courses, I give a shoutout to professors who went above and beyond in teaching. Please keep in mind that the difficulty and review I provide is subjective to my personal experiences immediately after finishing each course; your mileage may vary.</p>

                    <p>This semester was affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic, so the University of Alberta made the decision to grade all courses on a CR/NC basis with no option for letter grades.</p>

The most difficult part about this course was not memorizing all 20 essential amino acids, but interpreting the multiple choice answers. A typical question is like (a) glycine, (b) arginine, (c) lysine, (d) all of the above, (e) none of the above, (f) a and b but not c, (g) b and c but not a. Although there is a textbook for this course, it's very dense and not very helpful. Khan Academy or the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube are higher yield resources.</p>

                                    <p>BIOCH 200 covers a wide range of topics. You will learn the following units in order: biomolecules, water, nucleotides and nucleic acids, protein structure and function, enzymes, biological membranes, metabolism, aerobic and catabolism of glucose. If you want to learn about metabolic pathways, you will need to take higher level BIOCH courses.</p>

                                    <p>Like CMPUT 274, I found this course to be transformative. This course focuses purely on algorithms and data structures in C++ (you will use C++ to program an Arduino). The best way to succeed here is to do a ton of practice, whether you use LeetCode, Kattis, HackerRank, etc. YouTube videos about specific algorithms may also be helpful. Perhaps the most stressful aspect about CMPUT 275 are the morning problems. In my year, morning problems were graded, 30-minute coding challenges that you needed to complete at the end of every class. The silver lining is that they are worth so little that you can get 0% on all of them and still pass the course with an A+. Be warned that CMPUT 275 is extremely fast-paced and will likely take up a huge portion of your time, so make sure to plan accordingly.</p>

                                    <p>In terms of concepts, you will learn the following classes of algorithms: brute force, divide and conquer, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming. Of note are the graph theory concepts like depth search first, breadth search first, and Dijkstra's algorithm. These graph concepts were used in the implementation of a Google Maps-esque project with an Arduino and a touchscreen display. You will also learn and implement common data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, min/max heaps, etc. In terms of systems concepts, you will learn hardware basic (circuit design, input, output), programming pipeline (compile, link, execute), makefiles, memory hierarchy, and caching. In my year, we also had a final project where we proposed, implemented, and presented a project.</p>

One YouTube series that was of great help was <a class="url" href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown's essense of linear algebra</a> as they give a fantastic gemoetrical perspective into the concepts you learn.

                                    <p>As with most introductions to linear algebra, you start by learning how to solve systems of linear equations with row and column operations. You then transition into vectors in n-space, matrix algebra, determinants, and linear transformations. The first part is likely the most intuitive portion of MATH 125. The second half of MATH 125 goes into more abstract topics such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, complex numbers, dot product, cross product, orthogonality, and diagonalization. Since the second half of the course is more conceptually difficult, try to do as well as possible on pre-midterm material.</p>

Each week, different lecturers come in to present on various topics ranging from psychiatry to neurosurgery. The course grade breakdown consists of two midterms worth 20% each and a final exam worth 60%. The first midterm will be the easiest exam you will ever write, as the class average is usually 90%+. Don't let this lull you into a false sense of security. The second exam is much more difficult relatively speaking, and the class average will be in the low 70s. The final exam is pretty reasonable and is on a difficulty level between the two midterms. All of the exams are multiple choice.</p>

                                    <p>I still have nightmares about the assignments and final exam from this course :<, so be warned. ENGG 130 is your standard introduction to statics, i.e., F<sub>net</sub> = 0. In this course, you will apply a bunch of seemingly random linear algebra concepts such as cross product, triple scalar product, determinants, and the such to solve really wacky 3D equilibrium problems. Don't worry about the math too much here; you will learn what all of it means in your linear algebra course (MATH 102) in the following semester. As I foreshadowed, this course is extremely computationally tedious (e.g., solving a system of equations with 7 unknowns). Each assignment may take a few hours of work just to chug through the algebra and geometry. To do well in this course, be EXTREMELY careful with your numbers and vectors, as one wrong number or sign can result in a catastrophically wrong answer. Also, try to do well on the assignments as the exams are quite difficult and will likely drag down your overall grade. Final word of advice: this course has consolidated exams across all sections, so no matter what prof you have, you will have the same exams. That means you can attend any prof's class and still do well. Also, check out <a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKW_dKcpFh358S1rV5qBDw" target="_blank">Jeff Hanson</a> on YouTube; he is hands-down the single factor that saved my grade in this class.

                                    <p>As with a standard statics class, you will learn about particle equilibrium, moments, equilibrium in 2D and 3D, truss analysis, bending moment diagrams, dry friction, centroids, and moments of inertia. The first part of the course involves a ton of algebra and geometry. The second part of the course involves calculus and geometry.</p>

The second part of MATH 101 will be essential in multivariable calculus (MATH 209), so learn the concepts well!

                                    <p>This course is loved by some, hated by others. If you have Dr. Moore, get ready for a ton of calculus and seemingly random derivations using math you will learn in your second-year math courses. Don't worry if you don't understand the derivations; focus on the key concepts and how to use the derived equations. There will be a ton of equations, so playing formula bingo will likely be detrimental to your course grade. The class GPA was 2.5/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>This course begins with oscillatory motion and the differential equations which govern such motion. You then will generalize simple harmonic oscillations into waves; you will be introduced to the wave equation, a partial differential equation which governs how waves propagate through space. These concepts will be applied to acoustic waves (e.g., bulk modulus, phase velocity, group velocity), which will lead to the power carried by waves. After this unit, you will cover optics. You will finish the course by considering light waves, which is arguably the most difficult part of this course because there are so many concepts that are similar yet very different to solve.</p>

                                    <p>This math course is quite controversial in terms of student enjoyment. Although technically an extension of calculus, this course takes a very different approach in terms of the rigour involved in the derivations and the way concepts are presented. At times, it will feel like the concepts are disconnected, as if you are learning a bag of tricks to solve ODEs and PDEs; in a sense, this is true. Differential equations are pretty fundamental in engineering, so make sure you learn the material in this course well. The class GPA was 2.4/4.0, though this math course was graded much more nicely in terms of part marks than the other calculus courses.</p>

For PDEs, you will learn how to solve the wave equation and the heat equation with many different boundary conditions.</p>

Tips for doing well include perusing <a class="url" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/" target="_blank">Paul's Online Math Notes</a> and grinding through as many practice exams as possible. Important concepts in this course include the chain rule for partial derivatives, line integrals, surface integrals, divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem (especially if you're an EE/CompE/EngPhys student as electromagnetism is written in the language of vector calculus). The class GPA was 1.7/4.0 (yikes!).</p>

                                    <p>This course essentially finishes the Stewart calculus textbook. You will start by learning about partial derivatives (e.g., chain rule, Lagrange multipliers, gradient), move on to multiple integrals (in multiple coordinate systems), and finish with the grand finale of vector calculus. The vector calculus unit is arguably the most important as you learn line integrals, surface integrals, curl / div / grad, divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem. The course final is consolidated across all sections, so all students will face an equally difficult exam during finals season!</p>

                                    <p>This course can count as either a complementary studies elective or impact of technology on society (ITS) elective, but not both. If you're hesitant about a 300-level SOC course, don't worry; all of the  concepts are easy to understand. In my opinion, SOC 366 was a fantastic introduction to historical and contemporary work perspectives with a nice nod to Canadian industries. You also learn about engineering industries, as this course is restricted to engineering students. Per Nicole's syllabus, "this course will challenge you to understand the role of engineers in driving industrial and social transformation, and provide insights into how such broad change impacts engineering work itself." Nicole's exams are very fair, and they are part multiple choice, part written. The only thing is that you should get ready to read ~50 pages of the textbook each week, as the exam will contain content from the text. Honestly, the best way to do well is to take good notes as the exams are open book. The class GPA was 3.4/4.0.</p>

You will finish by exploring households, family, care, the meaning of work, alternative approaches, and the future of work (especially related to technological change). Many of the concepts are directly relevant to our everyday lives, so I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any interested engineering student.</p>

My top tips for doing well is to create a killer formula sheet, practice as many assignment and practice exam questions as possible, and develop a strategy for recognizing when different tests or probability distributions are used. In my year, the stat labs were optional attendance to any open section. I would recommend attending as the TAs pretty much just tell you the answers to the labs.

In the probability section, you will learn about the axioms of probability, random variables, and discrete and continuous probability distributions. The statistical test portion include t-tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and inferences for proportions. Linear regression will be a HUGE focus in this course, as it is extremely important in many future courses (and likely in your future career). As such, it will also be a major focus in the exams, so ensure you know it inside and out.</p>

Dr. Lewis was a gem who made math fun, had VERY flexible deadlines, and wore his world-famous suspenders to class each day. This course is the complex calculus analogue to real analysis. You will learn about complex functions, Cauchy's equation, residues, and more fun things. Many of the proofs in this course involve drawing pretty diagrams and epsilon-delta arguments. Lewis had open-book exams which focused mainly on computations, which made the class trivial to pass. The class GPA was 3.1/4.0.</td>

PHYS 292 is a very chill class that you take once a week, and it rotates between lecture and lab each week. The lectures will introduce you to the relevant physics concepts and statistical chops you need to complete the lab in the following week. You typically have one week to complete the lab report, but for the big formal lab report, you'll have two-to-three weeks to write up to 10 pages of "research." Be warned, you will likely need to do self-studying to learn how to use the statistical tests presented. You will also learn how to use Python to analyze data (though if you're lazy or are a masochist, you're allowed to use Excel for analysis later on). The coolest experiment in this course (in my humble opinion) is the superconductor lab, where you get to make a superconductor and hover a magnet over it when the superconductor is cooled with liquid nitrogen. Do well in this course as your course mark is determined at the end of PHYS 292B in the next semeseter, which takes into account your grades in PHYS 292A.</td>

In my opinion, the best way to do well in this course is to grind practice problems and sample exams.

Don't worry if you're rusty at solving ODEs—this course presents many shortcuts to solving them. The second part of this course analyzes circuits in the frequency domain. Here, we rely on phasors and eventually the Laplace transform. Bode plots are also introduced to analyze the frequency response of circuits. The third part of this course studies operational amplifiers and diodes, which play a key role in larger integrated circuits.</p>

You then learn the relationship between the Fourier and Laplace transforms. You also touch on cool topics such as AM radio and filter design (filters are also covered in ECE 203). Overall, this was a very straightforward course where you prove various properties then use them to solve computational problems. If can do the assignments and practice exams, you will do well in the course. As for the prof, Horacio was pretty great at teaching and his exams were quite fair.

                                    <p>The most difficult part about this course is setting up the equations and being extremely diligent with algrebra/calculus. Each assignment took multiple hours to complete, so beware. Nonetheless, you will prove interesting problems in the assignments, such as: (i) Is there a contradiction in Netwon's third law for two charges approaching each other from orthogonal angles?. (ii) What is the angular frequency of a spring on a rotating system? (iii) Why do planets orbit the sun such that the line between the planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times? (iv) How do we generate symmetry? To do well in this course, understand the fundamental theorems well, be careful with your computations, and practice, practice, practice!</p>

                                    <p>The first half of this course reviews many concepts from first year physics but takes them one step further; you'll learn Newtonian mechanics in polar and cylindrical coordiantes, intrinsic coordinates, velocity-dependent forces (e.g., drag), linear and angular momentum, and energy in the context of vector calculus. Then, you will analyze oscillating systems: damped oscillations, coupled oscillators, and small oscillations. The second half of this course is where things get spicy. You first prove the Euler-Lagrange equations and other topics in calculus of variations (e.g., geodesic problems, Brachistochrone problem) then use the Euler-Lagrange equation in the context of Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics is a powerful extension of Newton's second law in scalar form, and you will be able to solve increasingly complex problems such as the double pendulum problem in an algorithmic manner. Lagrangian mechanics leads to one of the most beautiful theorems about symmetry and conserved quantities: Noether's theorem. Towards the end of the course, you will learn about two-body central force problems, an extension of Lagrangian mechanics, which plays a critical role in orbital mechanics and quantum mechanics. Finally, you will cover the basics of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

                                    <p>Ever watched Intestellar or wondered what Einstein did? Well now you can learn all about it! This course was a whirlwind introduction to special relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. JP is a pretty chill and funny prof, so you're in good hands in this course (though I'm not a fan of the PowerPoint slides you learn from). The special relativity unit is arguably the wackiest, where you learn about time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic mechanics. You will also learn that E = mc<sup>2</sup> is simply a special case of the more general energy-momentum relationship, E<sup>2</sup> = m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> (this relationship will be derived by integrating the derivative of relativistic momentum with respect to position). After special relativity, you'll learn how light and charge became quantized and then delve into wave-particle duality alongside the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You will then derive the Schrodinger equation and see how it leads to many crazy phenomena like quantum tunnelling and the EPR paradox. You will finish the course by deriving the quantum numbers (which form the basis for modern chemistry) and see the necessity for relativistic quantum mechanics. The class GPA for this course was 2.6/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>Honestly, the best way to do well in this course is to take advantage of the extremely easy quizzes as the midterm and final will likely drag down your mark. For the special relativity unit, understand the meaning behind every equation, as plug and chug will not work here. For quantum mechanics, learn how to solve the Schrodinger equation and how to interpret and use the equations you derive from it. For most students, special relativity is a lot more difficult to understand than the quantum mechanics unit.</p>
